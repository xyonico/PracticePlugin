### Plugin for Beat Saber to control playback speed, seek through songs and set up looping sections.
##### Original Plugin made by Xyonico: https://github.com/xyonico/PracticePlugin
![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/vdpHLbR.png)

# Usage
- The UI shown above for the plugin will activate in practice mode, which can be accessed using the small button next to the play button
- Move the blue diamond below the seeker to where you want the loop to start and move the red diamond to where you want the loop to end.
- The Song will only loop if the red diamond is not at the end of the song
- The Speed, NJS, and spawn offset will reset to that of the song upon starting or restarting the song
- Note: If you set a starting time for the song using the built in practice mode, the map literally starts at that point, so going back to before the starting point in practice plugin won't have any notes
